# VirtualMaze
VirtualMaze is a virtual reality environment that an animal can be trained to
navigate.  Once the animals are trained, their brains activity will be recorded
while they navigate through the virtual environment via a robotic platform.
Information acquired from this project will then be compared to the activity
recorded when navigating through a real maze.
